# Research for SRA Classifier

This directory is for collaborative research on the SRA Classifier project. Typically, 
contributions to this directory will be in the form of jupyter notebooks (or RMarkdown). 

Relevant tasks:
1. Trying and testing previous classifier (e.g., MetaSRA, CellO)
2. Testing and benchmarking various classifier approaches
3. Determining optimal approaches for assigning hierarchical labels using ontologies (e.g., Cell Ontology)
4. Tuning and optimizing classifier models. 
5. Generating relevant figures and methods for publication
