# CellO Dataset

This is the data from the CellO study, found online here: https://zenodo.org/record/4289064#.YBiXCOhKhPZ

The main dataset of interest will be `bulk_RNA_seq_training_set/bulk_log_tpm.h5` as this contains the log TPM (log-transformed transcripts per million) for the bulk RNA-Seq samples used to train CellO. Additionally, `bulk_RNA_seq_training_set/bulk_log_tpm.h5` contains the cell type labels which were assigned by MetaSRA to each bulk RNA-Seq sample.
